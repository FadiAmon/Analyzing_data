# Analyzing_data

In this notebook I completed most of the tasks myself, but the lecturer demonstrated some of them.
The notebook deals with scraping and collecting data from websites using the requests package and API, and parsing the data through various methods. 
Additionally, the data was visualized using graphs, histograms, and other methods.
